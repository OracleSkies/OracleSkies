- 👋 Hi, I’m @OracleSkies. I am a fairly beginner programmer :)
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming and Programming
- 🌱 I'm currently working my way on getting my degree in Computer Engineering. I’m currently learning and dabbling on game development using UNITY Engine. I might transition to Godot because of UNITY controversy, who knows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting projects that would help me develop my programming skills.
